        Artopod is a single-page application by
        <a href="https://siwinlo.github.io"> Siwin Lo</a>, which finds 5 art
        exhibitions close to you, and lets you take it from there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perfect for a New York-paced lunch-hour and inspired by location-based
        apps like Tinder and Yelp, Artopod helps users find art shows close by
        without the overwhelming choice and cumbersome nature of traditional
        listings.
